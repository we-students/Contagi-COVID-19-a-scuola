The dependency management is handled by [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The folder stucter of the webapp is grouped by concerns. In particular:

-   **pages**. This contains the pages.
-   **components**. This contains the components.
-   **utils**. This contains all kind of utils needed, used accross the app.
    -   **data**. This contains the data fetching helpers.

## Code style

The source code is linted by Eslint and enforced by Prettier. All the code pushed to the repo, in every branch, must be compliant to the code style config.

# Gitflow

This repository adopts a branch management system inspired by [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

The main branches are as follows:

-   **Master**. The _master branch_ contains the codebase that has reached the production environment. Commits are manually merged in this branch by project maintainers.
-   **Development**. The _development branch_ is where development takes place. This branch serves as an integration branch for features and fixesâ€”it.

## Feature and fixes

When contributors wish to implement a new feature or a fix, they should branch from the development branch and open a pull request. Branches should have a meaningful name that adheres to the following convention:

```
<type>/name_of_feature_or_fix.
```

The _type_ prefix should be one of the following:

-   **feature**. Used in the case that the branch implements a new feature.
-   **fix**. Used in the case that the branch implements a fix.

Valid branch names are:

-   _feature/onboarding_
-   _fix/paddings_

Invalid branch names are:

-   _feat/onboarding_
-   _fix_paddings_
